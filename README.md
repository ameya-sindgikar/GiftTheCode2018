# Gift The Code 2018
## Disconnect
Boys & Girls Clubs of Canada’s mission is to provide safe, supportive places where children and youth can experience new opportunities, overcome barriers, build positive relationships, and develop confidence and skills for life. They are looking to increase awareness of their #UnplugToConnect campaign, that promotes people to unplug from their screen and connect with each other. Their challenges include being able to reach a larger audience and increasing social media presence, in addition to not having crucial participation data.

Disconnect is a web application that aims to address and overcome these challenges using a low-friction website, that captures high-value data with three button clicks. Users will have the opportunity to “Unplug”, which will lead to a dark full screen which continues until the user decides to go back online. Once they are back, users are asked about the category of their activity while offline. It then provides the user with an opportunity to share their participation to social media where they can challenge friends and show time they spent offline. Finally, it brings the user to a page with more information about the event and Boys & Girls Clubs of Canada. On the back end, data about the user, their location, activity type, and duration is collected. Stats about the number of users that have participated and the total time unplugged is tracked and updated.
